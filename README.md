# [Calculator-Redux](https://mattmatters.github.io/calculator-redux/) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/mattmatters/calculator-redux.svg?branch=master)]

This is a fully functioning chain-based calculator.  This was made primarily for myself as an exercise in using redux's state management combined with React's rendering capabilities.


## Installation

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/mattmatters/calculator-redux.git"
cd calculator-redux
npm install
```

Upon installing you may type `npm start` to run the application through a dev server.
